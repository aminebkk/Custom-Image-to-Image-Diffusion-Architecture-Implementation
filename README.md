 Implement a custom architecture inspired by image-to-image Diffusion models. The model, comprising an image encoder, text encoder, U-Net, and image decoder, processes an initial image and accompanying text input to generate an image that aligns with both inputs. The image encoder and text encoder encode the respective inputs, feeding them into the U-Net for further processing. The output of the U-Net serves as input for the image decoder, resulting in the final image output.
