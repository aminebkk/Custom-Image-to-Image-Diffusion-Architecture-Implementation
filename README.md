# Custom-Image-to-Image-Diffusion-Architecture-Implementation
 Implement a bespoke architecture inspired by image-to-image Diffusion models. This model integrates an image encoder, text encoder, U-Net, and image decoder. It takes an initial image and text input, processes them through the encoders, utilizes the U-Net for further refinement, and finally generates the desired image output.
